On your receipt, you'll see these items marked with an asterisk: *. VATable products are taxed at the standard rate of 20%; you can read more on the Government's VAT info page.Delivery charges and money-off vouchers are not charged at the standard rate – the taxman doesn't make life easy – both are currently taxed at a rate of 6.1%.Here's an example of how we work out VAT:One of our customers, Mr Hammond, ordered an £8 bottle of wine with his shopping. The 20% VAT came to £1.33.Mr Hammond had a delivery charge of £5.49. The 6.1% VAT came to 31p.Also, he had a money-off voucher for £10.

These items are usually fresh produce such as meat, fish, fruit and vegetables for which we use ‘catch-weight pricing’. What is catch-weight pricing?Some fresh produce such as meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are priced according to their size and weight - something we won’t know until your precise cut of meat, or exact portion of vegetables, are picked, packed and delivered to you. To give customers the best idea of what they’ll pay for these items, we provide a ‘typical weight range’ along with a ‘typical price per item’ on the product page - the final price may differ very slightly depending on the product’s exact size and weight. This ‘typical price’ is then used to estimate your total before delivery, and once your order is delivered, we recalculate your total based on the size of the catch-weight items you received.",https://help.ocado.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018128871-Why-is-the-total-price-on-my-receipt-different-from-the-estimated-total-price-I-was-given-when-I-ordered-

195,Why are free range eggs currently unavailable in the UK?,"The Government, through the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) imposed a housing order on poultry kept across England, with devolved authorities in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland following suit. This housing order was put in place for 16 weeks, in Autumn 2022. However, due to recent outbreaks, the housing order will remain in place after the 1st February, 2023.This means that free range hens and poultry must be kept inside, and eggs previously classified as free range must be classified as barn eggs.The reasoning is that, in doing so, contact between wild birds and farmed animals will be minimised – cutting the risk of the H5N8 strain of avian influenza (bird flu) that is now endemic across the European continent and infecting farms.At Ocado we wanted to reassure you that the free range birds that supply our eggs, even though they may be housed, continue to be reared to the highest standards of animal welfare.",https://help.ocado.com/hc/en-us/articles/9457433028114-Why-are-free-range-eggs-currently-unavailable-in-the-UK-
